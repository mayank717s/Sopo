As social media is not just a platform of communication but also holds a mass collection data which could be any image, article, news, memes etc.. which is shared all across the world. The problem exists here is that, if something is shared across the social media it, the users can’t find whether the message being conveyed through the post is authentic or not, most of the time it is found that the news spread across the social media is a fake or manipulated as recently seen after US 2020 elections, which lead riot at the capitol. Often fake news and manipulated media leads to several losses to an individual or a group.

In this project we will build a Social Media Post Authenticity Checker App using different languages & Designing tools like Flutter, Dart, Genymotion emulator, Gimp which will help normal end user of social media websites to verify & authenticate the information of the post. This application will help in reducing spread of fake news and information which will be beneficial to the society.

Tools used for project include IDE's such as Android Studio and Microsoft’s VS Code which are renowned in the programming world as one of the best IDE's for coding. Technology used for the deployment of the project includes Flutter which is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications. Dart is the logical language used in flutter as programming language, Gimp for logo and icon design. Firebase for Machine Learning API for scanning image text in the social media post on the internet.

The resultant Social Media Post Authenticity Checker application which is developed will be useful in finding out the source of information represented in the social media post on social media websites. It’s User Interface is quite easy to use that even a person who is not fluent with technology can use it.

In the we would like to say our will help the end user and the society to verify the sources of the posts that are present on the internet and various social media websites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. It will help the society to move forward in a positive way and will also help in reducing rumours and panic around in the society caused by such fake and morphed social media posts and will also the law enforcement and well as the social media company to catch or suspends those accounts who are spreading rumours on a regular basis.
